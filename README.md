# Cableray.name Rails Webdesign Website

This is my personal website. I decided to build it in rails as a showcase of my expertise. I chose [refinery](http://refinerycms.com) for the back end cms, since I didn't need specific functionality, and wrote a few extensions for it where I needed added features. Most of the front end layout uses [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

## Extensions

### Projects

This extension showcases projects I've worked on and links them to their repo. Right now it's a simple single-model engine.


## To-Do

- Probably add a blog (I'll use the pre-built blog extension for that)
- Improve projects extension
- Abstract the changes I made to make refinery work with twitter bootstrap so that it's easy to generate a refinery & bootstrap app out of the box
